  # How this works:
  #
  # If a module wants to enable theme switching it adds an entry to the
  # switchApps option attribute set. The entry contains paths to the xdg config
  # files generated by the module. We change the target of the files home.file
  # attribute to .local/share/darkman/variants/PATH.dark where PATH is the
  # original file path relative to $HOME. It's named .dark because it is
  # assumed that all apps are originally configured as dark themes.
  #
  # To generate the light theme, we use a script that runs every time hm
  # activates. The script uses sed to replace all occurences of base16 dark
  # colors with their base16 light counterpart. This generates a new file at
  # .local/share/darkman/variants/PATH.light. Now we have a light and dark
  # variant, but the original config file does not exist. We create a new
  # home.file entry with a target of PATH (the original config path) and source
  # being an outOfStoreSymlink that points to darkman/variant/PATH. The file
  # darkman/variant/PATH is generated in our home manager activation script and
  # its contents is swapped to darkman/variant/PATH.light or
  # darkman/variant/PATH.dark whenever darkman performs a theme switch. Because
  # the file is created by us and pointed to by a symlink, we can safely modify
  # it without home manager complaining.
  #
  # Key points:
  # - All theme variants are stored in ~/.local/share/darkman/variants
  # - Application config files are replaced with outOfStoreSymlinks to ~/.local/share/darkman/variants/*
  # - Configs in ~/.local/share/darkman/variants/* are modified to switch themes

  # Modify the existing home file entry to point at our custom
  # target and create a new home file entry with the original
  # target. This is the config file we will modify at runtime to switch
  # themes as it uses an out of store symlink.
